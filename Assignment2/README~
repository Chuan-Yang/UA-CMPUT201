Does the following (see draw1b.c comment for more details)

Read one line at a time
========================
1. Take the first word out to the str[] from line.
2. compare every first word to the 8 words required in the question.
3. After the comparing, handle the different command:
	     # - comments directly print to the stdout
	 Image - record the start points and the image name to the struct image
     	lineTo - record the points int the latest image
	 print - use the function print_stdout(), ouput the image
		 and handle the empty image
	  draw - use the function draw(), send the "drawSegment" command to the
		 fppo, i.e. the Sketchpad
     translate - use the function translate, move the whole image
	rotate - use the function rotate(), first translate the angle_dgree to angle_radius in the main(),
		 then use this function to move the image
4. For every part in the main, use 1. the return value of sscanf
				   2. in_iamge to check if other commands except lineTo and comment will appear 				      between Image and End
				   3. start_image to check if the begin image and the end image match.
				   4. "else" to find the unvalid first word
   these 4 steps to handle the special errors and situations.
5. At the beginning of the code, use argc to check if the shell command is valid. 
6. Also, use str to delete the space in the beginning of every line.



Compile by typing make.
